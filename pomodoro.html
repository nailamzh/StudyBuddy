    <p>1. Pick a task from the Kanban table, and set your desired study session (usually 25 minutes) and break length (usually 5 minutes). </p>
      <p>2. Work until the study session is over and enjoy that break.</p>
      <p>3. Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break - you have earned it!</p>
      <p>4. Repeat the cycle as needed for productive work.</p>

      <h3>What is the Pomodoro technique?</h3>
      <p>The Pomodoro technique was created by Francesco Cirillo, who found long work tasks overwhelming. Instead, he broke work into smaller, more manageable chunks and gave himself a 25 minute period to complete each task. This enhanced focus and helped him to maintain a high level of productivity and motivation whilst working. Taking regular breaks also helped prevent burnout and meant Cirillo could sustain energy throughout the workday. By implementing this technique in your revision, you will focus better and spread out your productivity levels throughout the day. This technique has enabled millions to adopt a healthier, more personalized approach to effective time management.</p>
